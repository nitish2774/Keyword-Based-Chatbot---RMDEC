# Keyword-Based-Chatbot---RMDEC
Designed and executed a  predefined chatbot for our college's official website to address student  queries and provide access to online resources, reducing response  time by up to 40%.


I developed a keyword-based chatbot for my project using HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript. 
The main purpose of this chatbot is to help students and faculty easily access collegerelated information such as department pages, notes, faculty details, academics, 
and facilities. 
On the technology side, I used HTML to build the structure with input fields and 
buttons, CSS for styling like background images, rounded buttons, and chatbox design, 
and JavaScript for the chatbot’s logic. 
The core approach I followed was to create a keyword-response system. I defined an 
array of keywords, and each keyword is linked either to a response message or to a 
redirect link. For example, if someone types “hello”, the bot replies with a greeting, and 
if they type “CSE notes”, it redirects them to the official notes page of the CSE 
department. 
I also integrated the Web Speech API, which enables voice input. So, instead of typing, 
a user can click the "Speak" button and interact with the chatbot using speech, which is 
then converted into text and processed in the same way. 
This project uses only vanilla JavaScript without any external libraries, making it simple 
and lightweight. 
Some of the key tags I used were <input> for text entry, <button> for actions, <img> for 
the logo and banner, and <script> for the chatbot’s logic. 
Overall, this chatbot is a lightweight information assistant.
